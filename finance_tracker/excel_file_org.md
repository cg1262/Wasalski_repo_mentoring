excel file is organized like this:

sheet Lease: 
I store here all lease installments i have with months, how many installments left, when is the last one and of course value, column where next to each month i see sum of installments are yet to be paid

sheet Yearly_Planned:
all things I know i need to pay for like car insurance, some house maintenance etc. Each with date so I know when this expense will come

sheet january - december:
sheets showing expenses and income for every month.
the most crucial part here is that it counts money left in previous month and it will add this value to projection for next month for example:
june
expenses - 8000
income - 10000
so my savings will be 2000. 
in july i have expenses - 8000
income - 10000
and 2000 from june, so in july i can spend and transfer to saving account 4000. 
in augsut i have expenses - 8000, income - 10000 so assuming that i transfered saved money in july to saving account i have 2000 in my account to spend. 


In this applications i need also functionality, that will show me projection of amount of money that i have in my savings account. To achieve this i need also in Kategorie category Savings
