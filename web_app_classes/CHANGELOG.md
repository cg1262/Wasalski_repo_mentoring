---

## [v0.03] - 2025-07-10

### Added
- **Sticky Table Headers**

## [v0.01] - 2025-07-10

### Fixed
- **Method Detection Issue**
  - Fixed `_extract_methods_from_class` method in `app.py:82`
  - Changed `inspect.ismethod` to `inspect.isfunction` for proper method detection
  - Removed redundant static method detection logic that was causing conflicts

### Technical Details
- **File:** `/Users/mateusz/Desktop/web_app_classes/app.py`
- **Line 82:** Changed method detection from `inspect.ismethod` to `inspect.isfunction`
- **Lines 95-107:** Removed duplicate static method detection code
- **Issue:** Methods were not being properly detected, causing "missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'" errors

### Root Cause
The original code was trying to extract methods using `inspect.ismethod` which only works for bound methods on class instances, not unbound methods on class definitions. This caused the `get_applications` and `get_scans` methods from the CheckmarxAPI class to not be detected properly.

### Impact
- âœ… `get_applications` method now works correctly
- âœ… `get_scans` method now works correctly
- âœ… All class methods are properly detected and executable
- âœ… No more "missing self argument" errors
